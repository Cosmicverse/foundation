 * Define a new `assign` function that works like
 * Object.assign() except that it copies property descriptors from
 * source objects into the target object instead of just copying
 * property values. This function copies all own properties, both
 * enumerable and non-enumerable. And because it copies descriptors,
 * it copies getter functions from source objects and overwrites setter
 * functions in the target object rather than invoking those getters and
 * setters.
 *
 * `assign` propagates any TypeErrors thrown by
 * Object.defineProperty(). This can occur if the target object is sealed
 * or frozen or if any of the source properties try to change an existing
 * non-configurable property on the target object.
 *
 * Note that the assign property is added to Object with
 * Object.defineProperty() so that the new function can be created as
 * a non-enumerable property like Object.assign().
